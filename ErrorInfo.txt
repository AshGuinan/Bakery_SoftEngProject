java.lang.IllegalStateException: 
Exception Description: Cannot use an EntityTransaction while using JTA.

UPDATE:18/11
Well, that was nice while it lasted.
Tried [and failed] to implement deletion functionality. 
Code has been commented out that results in a null pointer exception, the one we have at the moment just doesn't seem to run.
Mind you, it's basically complaining about DB connectivity -- could be just me here.

All's good! :D
Now onto implementing a facade class and deleting cakes! Perhaps even log-in!
